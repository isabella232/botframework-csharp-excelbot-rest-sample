## Introduction.
<a name="introduction"></a>
Excel Bot is a sample that demonstrates how to use the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io) and specifically the [Excel REST API](https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/excel) to access Excel workbooks stored in OneDrive for Business through a conversational user interface. It is written in C# and it uses the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) and the [Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)](https://www.luis.ai/).

*Note*: The code in this sample was originally written for a user experience prototype and does not necessarily demonstrate how to create production quality code.

## Prerequisites.

## Register the bot.

Complete the these steps to setup your development environment to build and test the Excel bot:

- Download and install the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator)

- Make a copy of **./ExcelBot/PrivateSettings.config.example** in the same directory. Name the file  to **PrivateSettings.config**.
- Open the ExcelBot.sln solution file
- Register the bot in the [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new)
- Copy the bot MicrosoftAppId and MicrosoftAppPassword to the PrivateSettings.config file
- Register the bot to call the Microsoft Graph.
- Copy the Azure Active Directory **Client Id** and **Secret** to the PrivateSettings.config file
- Create a new model in the [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai) service
- Import the LUIS\excelbot.json file into LUIS
- Train and publish the LUIS model
- Copy the LUIS model id and subscription key to the Dialogs\ExcelBotDialog.cs file
- (Optional) Enable Web Chat for the bot in the Bot Framework and copy the Web Chat embed template the chat.htm file
- (Optional) To get the bot to send telemetry to [Visual Studio Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/), copy the instrumentation key to the following files: ApplicationInsights.config, default.htm, loggedin.htm, chat.htm
- Build the solution
- Press F5 to start the bot locally
- Test the bot locally with the [Bot Framework Emulator](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/tools/bot-framework-emulator)
- Create an Azure Cosmos DB in Azure that uses the SQL API
- Replace the bots host name in the PrivateSettings.config file
- Replace the database URI and key in the PrivateSettings.config file
- Publish the solution to the Azure web app
- Test the deployed bot using the Web Chat control by browsing to the chat.htm page
